                    <h1>How do you get to Fiji??</h1>

                   In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Fiji may seem far away, but it is very easy to get there. Fiji Airways has regular flights from international destinations (Sydney, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Vancouver and Hong Kong). Jetstar, Korean Air, Pacific Blue, Virgin Australia and Fiji Airlines also fly regularly to Fiji.
                Nadi International Airport is the main airport to the country for most travelers, and there are several domestic airport throughout other parts of the islands. A 4 month visa is granted on arrival to visitors from most countries. You dont need anything other than a passport that is valid for at least 6 months beyond your stay. Countries that are not on the list to receive automatic visas will have to apply  through their nearest Fiji High Commission.</p>

                    <h1>How long does it take to fly to Fiji??</h1>
                
                <p> Fiji is about a 10 1/2-hour non-stop flight from Los Angeles. Your flight schedule will add 2 days to your arrival time. It doesn't take two days of flying just two calendar days will pass. You will leave LAX in the evening than pass the midnight hour and into another day. Right before landing you will pass the international dateline and move into day two. Flying back to the US and re-transiting of the international dateline, you will gain back the two days you lost.
                    Once you are in Fiji it is a 4-hour flight to Sydney or due south to Auckland, New Zealand. Most people assume that Fiji is close to French Polynesia. Tahiti is eastbound, back across the dateline, about 6 hours flying time. Fiji Airways is the national airline of Fiji and offer a number of services between North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and other islands in the South Pacific.</p>

                    <h1>When is a good time to go??</h1>
                    
                <p>Fiji has a year-round tropical climate. But there are seasons and regions to consider. November to April considered Summer. (Remember Fiji is the Southern Hemisphere but not so far below the equator that there are drastic temperature variances). Temperatures and humidity tend to be higher (85-92F) in the lush tropical rainforests of the northern islands. From May to October the climate is generally milder (75-82F) and drier.</p>
